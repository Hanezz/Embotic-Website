            <h2><u>Bot/Server TOS</u></h2>
            <txt>Author: Luke The Nyan Gamer</txt>
            <p>1. No using other bots and/or selfbots to cheat or get more rewards with @Embotic, this is also against discord ToS, and can result in a discord ban.
            Macros/AutoTypers are not allowed, as this gives you an unfair advantage to certain commands/games that other users do not have.</p>
            <p>2. Don't try to break the bot. If you are seen or reported with evidence to be spamming the bot, using errored commands even after they errored out,
            or trying to use memory heavy usage commands multiple times for no apparent reason.</p>
            <p>3. You can not use language offensive to certain groups. You can use this elsewhere, but not on the bot.</p>
            <p>4. Spreading rumors about the bot, owners, or staff is forbidden under any circumstances.</p>
            <p>5. Using any unreleased command or leaking them will get you and the server you used them in blacklisted from using the bot.</p>
            <p>IF a user is found to have broke one of the above, I/staff can blacklist you temporarily or permanently, or even reporting to discord, depending on the severity of the rules broken.</p>
            <p>These rules can change any time, and a user is bound to these new rules, rather than the old ones.</p>
            <p>You may report a user in a staffs DMs. If a staff is in the server of the user breaking the rules, you may include a message link, as that is the best option. You may also send a
            screenshot for minor offenses. Major rules broken will require a short video to ensure the user has not edited anything.</p>
